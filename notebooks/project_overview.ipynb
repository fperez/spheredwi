      "- This study aims to improve the acquisition time and/or quality of reconstruction of tractographies based on diffusion weighted MRI data.\n",
      "- Current approaches suffer from:\n",
      "  - Low resolution sampling but high resolution desired outcome (2-3mm scan resolution, good for major white matter pathways, but not for micrometer axons)\n",
      "  - Long acquisition times\n",
      "  - Reconstruction inaccuracies due to uncertainty in gradient directions, dropped directions, low SNR, model unknowns (# directions etc.)\n",
      "- This project:\n",
      "  - Single-shell HARDI imaging: at each voxel, presented with values sampled at a constant b-value but in varying directions\n",
      "  - Q-space is sampled sparsely: saves acquisition time\n",
      "  - Alternative approach: diffusion spectrum imaging [Eleftherios] or QBI\n",
      "  - In which gradient directions should Q-space be sampled?  Determined by the gradient directions, and controlled by us.  Typical grids:\n",
      "     - Minimum energy grid\n",
      "     - Random grid\n",
      "     - Optimal quadrature points (introduced by this study)\n",
      "  - Random grid: advantage of arbitrary # of points, points can be dropped, variable scan duration\n",
      "  - Optimal quadrature points: \"optimal\" representation, as far as integration over the sphere goes\n",
      "     - Integration over the sphere is important when computing coefficients of spherical harmonics via inner product\n",

      "- Higher b-value, lower SNR, higher directional selectivity\n",
      "- ^ Also, error in control of b-directions due to D2A conversion\n",
      "- Typical b-values of around 2000\n",
      "- SNR loss with increased b: b proportional to G^2 t^3. We'd like short t, have to generate stronger G.  b of 2000 (relatively strong), t_E around 110ms...signal already fairly decayed.\n",
      "- Prefer to jump around in gradient directions. Heat induction in coils, try not to hit same parts each time to allow optimal cooling.\n",
